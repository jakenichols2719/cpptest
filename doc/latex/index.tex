A very basic c++ testing suite using $<$function$>$ and lambda expressions to create and run tests.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Setup}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
Add as a git submodule and include {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{cpptest_8h_source}{cpptest/src/headers/cpptest.\+h}}} and everything is set. Alternatively, you can download the src folder and include it directly--either way, including and compiling with {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{cpptest_8h_source}{cpptest.\+h}}} will allow test creation.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
Below is a template for creating a test manager, a basic test, and then running it.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{TestManager tman;}
\DoxyCodeLine{tman.NewTest("{}Test"{})-\/>Run = []() \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    assert(/*insert statement here*/)}
\DoxyCodeLine{    assert(/*insert statement here*/)}
\DoxyCodeLine{    assert(/*insert statement here*/)}
\DoxyCodeLine{    return true;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{tman.RunAll();}

\end{DoxyCode}

If you want to modify this, I just ask that you follow usual Git\+Hub ettiquite and not merge to main. Otherwise, go wild--the purpose of this project is for me to have my own testing suite to use for class, so I\textquotesingle{}m not bothered by other people doing what they want with it as long as the just-\/my-\/edits copy sticks around.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Boilerplate Notes (\+DO NOT REMOVE)}\label{index_autotoc_md5}
This project is built on a boilerplate setup created by Jake Nichols (109450366), specifically for CSCI 3753 and 3010 at CU Boulder, but generally functional for C programming. It provides testing functionality, formatting, and linting to create readable, consistent, and working code. The base setup can be found at their Git\+Hub page here. Please see the license for usage information.
